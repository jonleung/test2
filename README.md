## Overview

The primary objective of the club fair is to get as many people to the first
club meeting as possible.

Your primary target: _freshman_.

There are three primary strategies to do this:

- [Be a fanatic peacock](#be-a-fanatic-peacock)
- [Be extremely welcoming](#be-extremely-welcoming)
- [Be prepared](#be-prepared)

If you do the first two, you'll look like this:

### Be a fanatic peacock

Get as much attention as possible, this means:

- Trying to get a booth in the middle of the event, not somewhere off to the
  side.
- Having a [giant eye-catching sign](#giant-eye-catching-sign) that is easy to see from far away.
- Having [desirable and unique items to give away/sell](#giveaways-or-items-to-sell)

### Be extremely welcoming

- Initiative conversation with everyone within a 2 meter radius around your
  booth
- Be as welcoming and friendly as possible
- Look and sound excited about Hack Club
- Meet each person where they are at

### Be prepared

- Create a list of questions that you think people will ask you and make sure
  that every officer answers the questions in a similar way
- Be explicit about who will be doing what ahead of time

## Before the club fair

- [Prep the team](#prep-the-team)
- [Create physical materials](#create-physical-materials)

### Prep the team

Make sure that everyone on the team has a clear understanding of what they need
to do for the club fair.

You could:

- have everyone read this document
- have a meeting to discuss who is doing what by when
- practice role playing the club fair (where someone acts as a potential new
  club member and someone else is a club officer at the club fair)

### Create physical materials

**Checklist overview:**

- [ ] Giant eye-catching sign
- [ ] Flyers
- [ ] Signup materials
  - [ ] Signup forms (perhaps 20 sheets of paper)
  - [ ] Clipboards (perhaps 3-6)
  - [ ] Pens (2x what you think you will need)
- [ ] Giveaways / item to sell
- [ ] Computers setup with demos

#### Giant eye-catching sign

You want your sign to:

- be big: as in 6 feet by 3 feet
- stand out: use a unique font and color
- be readable from across the room

Other clubs have found that buying paint and painting a giant poster board
to be an effective way to make a sign.

<!-- TODO: Get examples -->

#### Flyers

You want your flyers to include:

- where room your club meetings are: `room 311`
- what day of the week and time you meet: `mondays at 3pm`
- themed graphics

<!-- TODO: Get examples -->

#### Sign-up materials

Some clubs have found it helpful to just use a physical signup form that has
the columns:

- full name
- email
- phone number

Make sure you have

- pre-made forms
- clipboards (you may want 3-6)
- pens (have 2x the amount of pens you need because they get lost)

You may want each officer to be holding a clipboard and leaving 3 clipboards on
the table for people to signup on.

<!-- TODO: Get examples -->

#### Giveaways or items to sell

You can attract people to the table if you have something to give away or sell.

A really good example is at the hackEDU club at Mission Vista High School,
it is their tradition to sell bags of kettle corn every club fair.

As a result, a _**GIANT**_ line forms in front of their booth. The other people
that see the line wonder what it is and wait in line as well!

Because there is a line now, their officers go up and down the line to greet
and talk to each person to convince them that programming club is awesome.

Some schools don't allow you sell things or giveaway food. In this situation,
think about what else you could provide that would make you stand out against
all the other clubs.

<!-- TODO: Get examples -->

#### Computers setup with demos

Have computers setup to show off several demos of what you've made at the club.
More on this later.

<!-- TODO: Get examples -->

### Prepare the team

- Try to have 3-5 people at the club fair
- Create a list of questions that you think people will ask you and make sure
  that every officer answers the questions in a similar way
- Be explicit about who will be doing what ahead of time

## During the club fair

Make sure that you are:

- [a fanatic peacock](#be-a-fanatic-peacock)
- [extremely welcoming](#be-extremely-welcoming)

Why is this important?
[Because first impressions make a big impact](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec07/).

### Map out the ideal experience of someone at a club fair

We find it is helpful to put yourself in the shoes of a newcomer when planning
an event and asking the questions

- "What do you this to look like?"
- "What don't you want this to look like?"

#### Initial Contact

**Not Ideal**

- They don't notice your clubs booth until the end of the club fair because
  nothing about your booth caught their attention.
- They never even see your table because it was all the way over to the side

**Ideal**

- They see your club's giant and colorful sign from across the room and they
  walk over.
- They hear that you are selling kettle corn and they want some so they stop by.
- They see a giant line in front of your booth and wonder what all the commotion
  is about and come over.
- They see all these people in pink t-shirts together and wonder what they're
  all about and walk over.
- They see some people in a dinosaur costume and wonder what the heck is going
  on and wander over.
- Their friends told them to go over because the people at your booth were so
  friendly and welcoming.

#### When they come up to your booth

**Not Ideal: Apathy**

- There is no one there.
- No one goes and talks to them.
- Talks to you briefly but they don't really make eye contact and walks away
  after a while.

**Ideal**

- They give you a very warm hello, a smile, and a
- They give you a handshake when you exit the booth and say, "See you next week
Tuesday Kevin"

**Not Ideal: Not Meeting People Where They Are**

- You walk over knowing nothing about computer programming and someone at the
  booth talks at you and bombards you with information about "if statements" and
  "while loops".
- You are really into programming and have programmed a lot and the other person
  starts talking to you about "if statements" and "while loops".

**DO NOT INITIALLY**
- use jargon
- focus on the _language_ or _tools_ you used to build the project
- focus on about _how_ the project works
- focus on the fact that _you_ built the project

**DO**
- talk about how you _felt_ when you accomplished the project
- talk about with _who else_ you worked with on your project
- talk about the _setting_ in which you built the project
  - was it during club, was it in a class?

  Level up by having a consistent theme for ## you do. That could mean
  your dress, physical materials, to how you interact with anyone will be dinosaur
  themed.

  For example, if everything might be dinosaur themed:

  - everyone would be wearing a dinosaur suit
  - you have dinosaur shaped crackers that you give out
  - there is a dinosaur on your poster
  - you demo a project about dinosaurs
  - etc.
  ```


## After the club fair

- Email everyone who signed up and make them feel welcome
